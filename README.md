# HCI_Prototype

Repository for the Human Computer Interaction major project

The goal of the project was to redesign the process of registering for courses at UOIT and Durham College. Throughout the development process we wanted the feedback and advice from other currently enrolled students in how to improve upon the current version of course registration. Based on the feedback gathered we created some initial designs of how the users would interact with the new design. The prototype was one of the last steps in the design process that we were learning in class. After presenting the prototype to a group of our peers we received further feedback on how we may change and improve upon this design iteration in the future.
